// LeetCode #489 (Robot Room Cleaner).

// Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

// Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

// The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. 
// Each turn it made is 90 degrees.

// When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle
// and it stays on the current cell.

// Notes:
// 1. The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. 
//    You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must control the robot
//    using only the mentioned 4 APIs, without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's
//    position.
// 2. The robot's initial position will always be in an accessible cell.
// 3. The initial direction of the robot will be facing up.
// 4. All accessible cells are connected, which means the all cells marked as 1 will be accessible
//    by the robot.
// 5. Assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by wall.
