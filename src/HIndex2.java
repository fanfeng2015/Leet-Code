// LeetCode #275 (H-Index II).

// Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative
// integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of 
// his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more
// than h citations each."

public class HIndex2 {

	public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
		int n = citations.length;
		int left = 0, right = n - 1;
		while (left <= right) {
			int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
			if (n - mid > citations[mid]) {
				left = mid + 1;
			} else {
				right = mid - 1;
			}
		}
		return n - left;
	}

	// Time complexity is O(log(n)).
	// Space complexity is O(1).
}
