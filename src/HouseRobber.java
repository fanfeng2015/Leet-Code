// LeetCode #198 (House Robber).

// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money
// stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems
// connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

// Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you
// can rob tonight without alerting the police.

public class HouseRobber {

	public int rob(int[] nums) {
		if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
			return 0;
		}
		int even = 0, odd = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
			if (i % 2 == 0) {
				even = Math.max(even + nums[i], odd);
			} else {
				odd = Math.max(odd + nums[i], even);
			}
		}
		return Math.max(even, odd);

	// Time complexity is O(n).
	// Space complexity is O(1).
