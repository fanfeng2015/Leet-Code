// LeetCode #291 (Word Pattern II).

// Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

// Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern
// and a non-empty substring in str.

// Note: You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
